# Volume Profile Viewer

A single-file HTML viewer for intraday volume profile CSVs. Open a file, pick an
instrument, and read its cumulated curve, its per-bucket shares, and the full
bucket table.

No build step, no dependencies, no network calls. One `.html` file you can mail
or drop into a chat, and it opens in any modern browser. The CSV is read locally
via `FileReader` and never leaves the machine.

## Use it

1. Open `volume-profile.html` in a browser.
2. Drop a CSV on the page, or click to browse.
3. Type an instrument code and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Optionally narrow **Scale from / to** to the buckets the vertical axis should
   be read against.

`sample_india_volume_profile.csv` is included so you can try it immediately.

## Input format

A metadata comment line, a header row (the leading `#` is optional), then one row
per time bucket:

```
#TimeZone=India Standard Time,format=V2,isweekly=false
#FidessaCode,ReutersCode,Venue,TimeZone,Time,CumulatedPercentage
ICICIBC.IN,ICBK.NS,NSI-MAIN,India Standard Time,9:15:00,0.0215
ICICIBC.IN,ICBK.NS,NSI-MAIN,India Standard Time,9:20:00,0.0431
```

`CumulatedPercentage` is cumulative, so each bucket's own share is the difference
from the previous row. The viewer computes that for you.

Parsing is deliberately tolerant, because these files get re-saved through Excel:

- delimiter auto-detected (`,` `;` tab `|`)
- decimal commas (`0,0215`)
- cumulated values as either `0..1` or `0..100`, detected from the data
- unpadded times (`9:15:00`), `HH:MM`, or Excel time serials
- a missing `#` on the header row, or a missing `ReutersCode` column
- instruments keyed by code **and** venue, so multi-venue files list them separately

Malformed rows are skipped and counted rather than failing the whole file.

## Time zones

The `TimeZone` column (falling back to the file's `#TimeZone=` line) is resolved
and every bucket is converted to the viewing machine's zone.

`India Standard Time` is a *Windows* zone name rather than an IANA id, so the
viewer carries a lookup table of ~140 Windows names, plus bare abbreviations
(`IST`, `CET`, `JST`) and literal offsets (`UTC+05:30`). Raw IANA ids pass
through untouched. Offsets are resolved through `Intl` at a reference date, so
daylight saving is computed rather than assumed. The date field lets you check a
different DST period.

Buckets that land on another calendar day are marked `-1d` / `+1d`, and rows stay
in session order rather than resorting around midnight. So 09:15 in Mumbai reads
as 05:45 in Paris, 13:45 in Sydney, and 23:45 `-1d` in New York.

A **Local / Source** toggle switches back to the file's own times. When the two
zones differ, the table shows both.

## Reading the charts

- **Cumulated volume**: share of the day traded up to each bucket. The dashed
  *even pace* line is what a flat, volume-blind schedule would trace, so
  front-loading and back-loading read at a glance.
- **Volume per bucket**: each bucket's own share, with a dashed *average bucket*
  reference.
- The shaded band at the left is the pre-open stretch, where the curve is flat by
  construction.

## Scale window

A closing auction can be 15-20% of the day, which flattens every intraday bar
against an axis tall enough to hold it. **Scale from / to** picks the stretch of
the session the vertical axis is computed from - leave the auction out and the
intraday shape gets the full height.

Both ends are dropdowns of the loaded instrument's own buckets, so the window can
only ever land on a real bucket; moving one end past the other pushes the other
along. **Full session** returns to the whole day.

The two charts use the window differently, and each says which in its caption:

- **Volume per bucket** is restricted to it. Only the window's buckets are drawn,
  the x-axis narrows to them, and the tallest bar on screen sets the ceiling - so
  nothing there is ever off-scale.
- **Cumulated volume** keeps the whole session and takes only its ceiling from
  the window, because that curve is read for its shape. Where it leaves the axis
  it is cut with break marks and annotated with the close it really reaches. A
  window ending at the close still needs the full 0-100% axis, so that chart is
  left alone.

The dashed *average bucket* reference stays the whole session's average whatever
window is on show, so it remains the same day-level benchmark. When a narrow
window's ceiling falls below it, the label says so rather than drawing it.

Hovering still syncs both charts and the table. A bucket outside the window has no
bar to point at, so the bar chart drops its crosshair while the curve and the
table row keep following it. The bucket table and **Export selection** are always
the full session.

The window survives a **Local / Source** flip, relabelled into the zone on show.
Picking another instrument starts again on the full session.

Hovering either chart syncs the crosshair, the bars, and the table row. With a
chart focused, arrow keys, <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> do the same. Table
columns sort, and **Export selection** writes the visible instrument out as CSV
with both source and converted times.

## Sample data

`sample_india_volume_profile.csv` is **synthetic**. The instrument codes are real
NSE constituents, but the volume curves are generated: a U-shaped intraday
profile with a heavy open, a midday lull, and a closing-auction spike, each
normalised to close on exactly 1. It contains no real market or client data. It
exists to exercise the viewer, not to describe any actual trading day.
